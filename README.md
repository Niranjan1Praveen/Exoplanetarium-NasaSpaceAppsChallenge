## 🌍 Modules Overview

### 🧠 1. Exoplanet Classification Tool (Flask App)
A **web-based ML classifier** that predicts whether an object is a **Confirmed Planet, Candidate, or False Positive**.  
- Accepts astrophysical parameters like *orbital period*, *transit depth*, *planet radius*, and *stellar radius*.  
- Utilizes **LightGBM** and **XGBoost** ensemble models for robust predictions.  
- Displays classification confidence scores through an intuitive interface.  

> 💡 In short, it's an intelligent prediction system powered by ensemble learning for exoplanet classification.

### ☁️ 2. Exoplanet Atmosphere Visualization API
A **Flask-based API** for retrieving and visualizing exoplanet atmosphere data.  
- Loads and normalizes CSV datasets from NASA archives.  
- Generates **synthetic transit and spectral curves** when data is incomplete.  
- Detects and lists key molecules (H₂O, CO₂, CH₄, etc.) in planetary atmospheres.  

**Main Endpoints**
```
/api/types      → Returns available planet types
/api/planets    → Lists planets by type
/api/data       → Returns detailed atmospheric & spectral data
```

> 🌌 This backend service powers the interactive visualizations in the frontend dashboard.

### 🔭 3. Exoplanet Discovery Methods (Educational Web App)
An **interactive educational module** built with **Next.js + Tailwind CSS**, showcasing five exoplanet detection techniques:  
- Transit Timing Variation (TTV)  
- Radial Velocity  
- Microlensing  
- Direct Imaging  
- Astrometry  

**Key Features**
- Animated, gradient-themed cards for each discovery method  
- Responsive grid layout with light/dark mode

### 🎨 4. Interactive 3D Planet Creator
A **creative AI-powered experience** allowing users to **draw and generate planets**.  
- Users sketch planetary textures on a circular canvas.  
- Real-time 3D sphere preview powered by **Three.js**.  
- **Google Gemini AI** analyzes colors to classify the planet (Terrestrial, Super-Earth, Gas Giant, etc.).  
- Educational explanations of each type are provided in real-time.  

**Tech Highlights**
- React Sketch Canvas + Three.js  
- AI Classification via Gemini  
- Responsive design across devices  

> 🧑‍🎨 Makes astronomy accessible and fun for all ages by merging creativity with science.
