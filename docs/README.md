## 🌍 Modules Overview

### 🧠 1. Exoplanet Classification Tool (Flask App)
![Classifier Inputs](designs/LabClassifierInputs.png)  
![Classifier Results](designs/LabClassifier.png)  
A **web-based ML classifier** that predicts whether an object is a **Confirmed Planet, Candidate, or False Positive**.  
- Accepts astrophysical parameters like *orbital period*, *transit depth*, *planet radius*, and *stellar radius*.  
- Utilizes **LightGBM** and **XGBoost** ensemble models for robust predictions.  
- Displays classification confidence scores through an intuitive interface.  

> 💡 In short, it's an intelligent prediction system powered by ensemble learning for exoplanet classification.

### ☁️ 2. Exoplanet Atmosphere Visualization API
![Atmospheric Analysis](designs/LabAtmosphere.png)  
A **Flask-based API** for retrieving and visualizing exoplanet atmosphere data.  
- Loads and normalizes CSV datasets from NASA archives.  
- Generates **synthetic transit and spectral curves** when data is incomplete.  
- Detects and lists key molecules (H₂O, CO₂, CH₄, etc.) in planetary atmospheres.  

**Main Endpoints**
```
/api/types      → Returns available planet types
/api/planets    → Lists planets by type
/api/data       → Returns detailed atmospheric & spectral data
```

> 🌌 This backend service powers the interactive visualizations in the frontend dashboard.
